In this mini-workshop we will introduce the `sf` package, show some examples of geospatial analysis, work with base plotting of `sf` objects, and show how `mapview` can be used to map these objects. It is assumed that you have [R and RStudio installed](https://github.com/rhodyrstats/intro_r_workshop#software) and that you, at a minimum, understand the basic concepts of the R language (e.g. you can work through[R For Cats](https://rforcats.net)).

Also as an aside, I am learning the `sf` package right now so, we will be learning all of this together!

# The `sf` package

Things are changing quickly in the R/spatial analysis world and the most fundamental change is via the `sf` package.  This package aims to replace `sp`, `rgdal`, and `rgeos`.  There are a lot of reasons why this is a good thing, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this workshop  Suffice it to say it should make things faster and simpler!

To get started, lets get `sf installed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
library("sf")
```

It does rely on having access the GDAL, GEOS, and Proj.4 libraries.  On Windows and Mac this should be pretty straightforward.

## Exercise 1
The first exercise won't be too thrilling, but we need to make sure everyone has the packages installed. 

1. Install `sf`.
2. Load `sf`.
3. If you don't have `dplyr` already, make sure it is installed.
4. Load `dplyr`.

# Reading in spatial data with `sf`

## Simple Features 
So, what does `sf` actually provide us?  It is an implementation of an ISO standard for storing spatial data.  It forms the basis for many of the common vector data models and is centered on the concept of a "feature".  Essentially a feature is any object in the real world.  There are many different types of features and there are different details that get stored about each. For details on this the [first `sf` vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf1.html) does a really nice job.  For this mini-workshop we are going to focus on three feature types, POINT, LINESTRING, and POLYGON.  For each of the types, there will be coordinates stored as dimensions, a coordinate reference system, and attributes.  

## Get some data to use

We can grab some data directly from the Rhode Island Geographic Information System (RIGIS) for these examples.  This code assumes you have a `data` folder in your current workspace.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Municipal Boundaries
download.file(url = "http://www.rigis.org/geodata/bnd/muni97d.zip",
              destfile = "data/muni97d.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "data/muni97d.zip", 
      exdir = "data")

# Streams
download.file(url = "http://www.rigis.org/geodata/hydro/streams.zip",
              destfile = "data/streams.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "data/streams.zip", 
      exdir = "data")

# Potential Growth Centers
download.file(url = "http://www.rigis.org/geodata/plan/growth06.zip",
              destfile = "data/growth06.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "data/growth06.zip", 
      exdir = "data")

# Land Use/Land Cover
download.file(url = "http://www.rigis.org/geodata/plan/rilc11d.zip",
              destfile = "data/rilc11d.zip")
unzip(zipfile = "data/rilc11d.zip", 
      exdir = "data")
```


## Data input

To pull the shapefiles in we can simply use the `st_read()` function.  This will create an object which is a simple feature collection of, in our case, POINT, LINESTRING, or POLYGON.  As an aside, many of the `sf` functions and all of the ones we will be using start with `st_`.  This stands for "spatial" and "temporal".  Take a look below for examples reading in each of our datasets.

### POINT

```{r}
growth_cent <- st_read("data/growth06.shp")
```

### LINESTRING

```{r}
streams <- st_read("data/streams.shp")
```


### POLYGON

```{r}
muni <- st_read("data/muni97d.shp")
```

```{r}
lulc <- st_read("data/rilc11d.shp")
```
## A word on performance

One of the benefits of using `sf` is the speed.  In my tests it is about twice as fast as the prior standard of `sp` and `rgdal`.  Let's look at a biggish shape file with 1 million points!

![1 million points](https://media4.giphy.com/media/13B1WmJg7HwjGU/giphy.gif)

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#The old way
system.time(rgdal::readOGR("data","big"))

#The sf way
system.time(st_read("data/big.shp"))
```

## Exercise 2

1. Make sure each of the shapefiles is read in.  Follow the instructions from above to complete this.  

# Basics of `sf` objects

One of the nicest features (pun intended) about `sf` objects is that they are nothing more than data frames.  The data for each feature (e.g. the attributes in ESRI speak) are stored in the data frames first columns.  The last column of the data frame is a "geometry" column which holds the coordinates, and coordinate reference system information.  I say this is nice becuase we don't need to completely learn a new way of working with spatial data.  Much of what we now about working with plain old tabular data frames will also work with `sf` objects.

We can use many of our base R skills directly with these objects.

```{r}
head(muni)
streams$NAME[1:10]
str(growth_cent)
```

## Manipulate `sf` objects with `dplyr`, yes, `dplyr`!

However, what is truly awesome, is the ability for us to now use `dplyr` to manipulate our spatial data and pipe our spatial workflows.  First let's make sure `dplyr` is loaded up.

```{r}
library("dplyr")
```

Now we can work with our spatial data.  Let's filter out the towns that are more than 

```{r}
big_muni <- muni %>%
  mutate(area_skm = AREA*.000000092903) %>%
  group_by(NAME) %>%
  summarize(sum_area_skm = sum(area_skm)) %>%
  filter(sum_area_skm >= 100)
big_muni
```

And first time I tried this, this happened:

## Exercise 3

Let's try the same thing with our land use/land cover data, except without the filter.  Use `dplyr` and

1. Add a column to convert area from acres to square kilometers
2. Group by LULC_2011
3. Sum up the square kilometers

# Plotting
There are default plotting methods for these sf objects, so we can use our base plotting tools to create some quick maps. 

## Base
plot(muni$geometry, col = muni$COUNTY)

## Mapview

## Exercise 4

# Analysis

## Buffer and summarize

## Exercise 5
