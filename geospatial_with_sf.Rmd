```{r setup, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, purl=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
options(repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/")

In this mini-workshop we will introduce the `sf` package, show some examples of geospatial analysis, work with base plotting of `sf` objects, and show how `mapview` can be used to map these objects. It is assumed that you have [R and RStudio installed](https://github.com/rhodyrstats/intro_r_workshop#software) and that you, at a minimum, understand the basic concepts of the R language (e.g. you can work through[R For Cats](https://rforcats.net)).

Also as an aside, I am learning the `sf` package right now so, we will be learning all of this together!

# The `sf` package

Things are changing quickly in the R/spatial analysis world and the most fundamental change is via the `sf` package.  This package aims to replace `sp`, `rgdal`, and `rgeos`.  There are a lot of reasons why this is a good thing, but that is a bit beyond the scope of this tutorial.  Suffice it to say it should make things faster and simpler!

To install `sf`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
library("sf")
```

## Simple Features 

## Exercise 1
The first exercise won't be too thrilling, but we need to make sure everyone has the packages installed. 

1. Install `sf`.
2. Load `sf`.
3. If you don't have `dplyr` already, make sure it is installed.
4. Load `dplyr`.

# Reading in spatial data with `sf`


## Get some data to use

## Read in points
```{r}
sf_rand <- st_read("rand.shp")
```

## Read in lines

## Read in polygons


## Performance

One of the benefits of using `sf` is the speed.  In my tests it is about twice as fast.  Let's look at a biggish shape file with 1 million points!

```{r}
#The old way
system.time(readOGR(".","big"))

#The sf way
system.time(st_read("big.shp"))
```

## Exercise 2

1. Read in shapefiles with 

# Basics of `sf` objects

## Its a data.frame!

## Manipulate `sf` objects with `dplyr`, yes, `dplyr`!

## Exercise 3

# Plotting

## Base

## Mapview

## Exercise 4

# Analysis

## Buffer and summarize

## Exercise 5
